# This code is used to show how Pi can be calculated from elastic collisions between two blocks on a frictionless surface

## There is a thorough discussion in the Jupyter Notebook, which you can interact with live in your browser (using Binder)

Just go to my [GitHub Pages site](https://asa55.github.io), then click the PiBlocks project link.

Wait for Binder to fully load (about 30 seconds) then click the `index.ipynb` file.

I also put up a slightly modified version of this as a Kaggle Kernel. [Check it out here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexboxer4/calculate-pi-from-elastic-collisions#538654)!

Enjoy the (hopefully helpful) tutorial!
