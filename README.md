# This code is used to show how Pi can be calculated from elastic collisions between two blocks on a frictionless surface

## There is a thorough discussion in the Jupyter Notebook, which you can interact with live in your browser (using Binder)

Just go to my [GitHub Pages site](https://asa55.github.io), then click the PiBlocks project link.

Wait for Binder to fully load (about 30 seconds) then click the `index.ipynb` file.

Enjoy the (hopefully helpful) tutorial!
