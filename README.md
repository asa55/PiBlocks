# This code is used to show how Pi can be calculated from elastic collisions between two blocks on a frictionless surface

## Before you look at my code, [check out Prajwal Souza's work on this problem!](https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html)!
I discovered his code soon after I made this repo, and after thinking about this problem for so long I realized immediately that his implementation is just amazing. What I appreciate the most is that we both made design decisions that make it easy for new users to play with the simulations in a web-based environment:
* His is HTML/CSS/JS, so there are literally no extra steps for you to take other than visiting his site.
* Mine is in pure Python, so I found a way for you to easily [run my code using Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/v2/gh/asa55/PiBlocks/master). (just click the `index.ipynb` file).
* I also put up a slightly modified version of this as a Kaggle Kernel, you can [view the Kaggle Kernel version here](https://www.kaggle.com/alexboxer4/calculate-pi-from-elastic-collisions#538654).

Lastly, if you're interested in learning about Prajwal Souza's (much cooler) code, I cleaned up and modularized a fork of the repo (still even with master branch as recently as June 24, 2019). The [before and after](https://github.com/asa55/Counting-Collisions-Before-And-After) repo just exists so you can see the functionality of the website didn't change at all when I cleaned up the code (i.e. I didn't introduce any bugs). I personally find my updates easier to navigate and understand, but I'll leave it up to you to decide which method you prefer =)

Hope you enjoy!
